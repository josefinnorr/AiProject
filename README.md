# GradeMate

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project builds an AI-powered grading assistant that helps teachers automatically grade student-written assignments based on specific rubrics. The system provides feedback on various aspects of writing, such as grammar, structure, clarity, and relevance to the prompt. The tool can be used by teachers to streamline the grading process and give more detailed and timely feedback to students.

## Background

Grading assignments manually and especially essays, can be time-consuming for teachers. This project aims to build a tool that can assess writing based on predefined criteria, helping teachers give more feedback to more students in less time. The model evaluates aspects like grammar, coherence, structure, and relevance to the assignment.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Grading written assignments is time-consuming and subjective.
* Teachers often struggle to provide detailed, individualized feedback for every student due to time constraints.
* There’s a lack of useful and accurate tools to help teachers evaluate multiple aspects of a student’s writing.


## How is it used?

This system can be used by teachers to grade and provide feedback on student essays, assignments, and reports. Teachers can upload assignment submissions, and the model will provide a report with scores for different aspects of the writing, such as grammar, structure, and relevance. The feedback can also suggest areas for improvement. Intended users are teachers (and other educators) or administrators looking for ways to streamline grading and give more detailed feedback.

## Key needs to consider:

Customizing the grading rubric based on the type of assignment or subject area.
Handling diverse student writing styles and subject matter.
Ensuring feedback is constructive and not overly critical, especially for younger writers.


## Challenges

- Subjectivity in grading: Even though the system uses predefined rubrics, grading written text is inherently subjective, and nuances can be missed by AI.
- Complexity of assignments: Different types of assignments (essays, reports, etc.) have varying criteria, and the system may need to be adapted for different types of writing.
- Limitations of grammar checkers: Simple grammar checks may not capture complex syntactic errors or stylistic issues.

Ethical considerations include ensuring the AI does not bias grading based on poor input data and that it complements rather than replaces the teacher's experience and knowledge.

## What next?

Integrate the system with an educational platform for automated assignment grading and feedback delivery.
